# Node+Express (4.13.1)

## Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **Start Express Server** : Click this to start your Express server.
1. **Preview** : Click to preview your app.

## Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your box can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
http://vital-ego.box.codio.io:9500/
```

## How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `Node.js, Grunt & MongoDB` Codio Certified Stack. We than ran the following commands before creating the Pack.

```bash
sudo npm install -g express
sudo npm install -g express-generator
express .
npm install
```
